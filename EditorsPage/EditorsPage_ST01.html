                        <p>
                            This splash screen effectively combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a smooth and visually engaging transition before redirecting to the home page. The HTML structure consists of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> container (.splash-screen), which centers the content, including a title, mission statement, team member list, and a loading animation. The CSS styling enhances the user experience with a full-screen background image for immersion, a glassmorphism effect using a semi-transparent background with blur for readability, and text animations (fadeIn) for smooth appearance. Additionally, a rotating loader (@keyframes spin) visually indicates progress, while a fade-out effect (opacity: 0) ensures a seamless transition before navigation. The JavaScript logic introduces a 4-second delay before redirecting, allowing users enough time to absorb the content. Overall, this design achieves a balance between functionality and aesthetics, delivering a professional and engaging user experience.

                        </p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>This splash screen incorporates several <b>accessibility considerations</b> to ensure a user-friendly experience for all visitors. The <b>HTML structure</b> is designed with clear headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the title and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> for descriptive text) to provide proper document hierarchy, aiding screen readers in navigating the content effectively. The <b>color contrast</b> between the text and the background ensures readability, with a semi-transparent dark overlay improving visibility against the bright background image. The <b>animations and transitions</b> are designed to be subtle and not overwhelming, reducing potential discomfort for users with motion sensitivity. Additionally, the <b>loading indicator</b> visually communicates progress, offering users clear feedback. The <b>JavaScript-based redirection</b> includes a <b>4-second delay</b>, allowing users enough time to process the content before navigating away. These accessibility-focused design choices help enhance usability for a diverse audience, including individuals with visual impairments or cognitive challenges.</p>

                <h2 id="volunteer">Volunteer Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The Volunteer Programs Page is structured using semantic HTML to ensure readability, organization, and accessibility.The volunteer programs are displayed using a grid layout (display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));), ensuring a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. The program-card component encapsulates each program, combining an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag for visual representation, a <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tag for the title, and a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag for descriptions. The program-table is designed with the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element to neatly present program duration, fees, and costs.</p>
                        <p>CSS techniques include flexbox (display: flex;) for buttons and navigation elements, ensuring alignment and equal distribution of space. Box shadows and border-radius enhance the card design, making it visually appealing while maintaining a clean layout. The use of color contrast (background-color: #007BFF; color: white;) improves readability, particularly in the navigation and call-to-action buttons.</p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The Volunteer Programs Page is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring a user-friendly experience for diverse users. Semantic HTML elements such as <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> enhance screen reader compatibility, making navigation more intuitive for visually impaired users. High-contrast colors are used throughout the page to improve readability, particularly in buttons and text sections, benefiting users with visual impairments.

                            Form elements like <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> are properly labeled to provide clear context, making data entry easier. The responsive grid layout ensures that the content remains accessible and well-structured across different screen sizes and devices. Additionally, interactive elements such as buttons feature hover effects and focus states (:hover, :focus), giving visual feedback to users navigating via keyboard. These accessibility enhancements contribute to a more inclusive and engaging volunteer program experience.</p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    During the implementation of both the <strong>Splash Screen</strong> and the <strong>Volunteer Programs Page</strong>, several challenges were encountered that required careful problem-solving and iteration. One of the main challenges in the <strong>Splash Screen</strong> was ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience while maintaining fast load times. Initially, high-resolution images and animations caused delays in rendering, negatively impacting performance. This was resolved by optimizing assets, using CSS animations instead of JavaScript for lightweight transitions, and implementing lazy loading to improve efficiency.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    For the <strong>Volunteer Programs Page</strong>, a major challenge was ensuring responsiveness and accessibility across different screen sizes. The grid layout for volunteer programs did not scale well initially, leading to overlapping content on smaller devices. This was fixed by applying CSS media queries and using a flexible grid system that adjusts dynamically. Additionally, contrast issues in text elements were identified, affecting readability. This was addressed by improving color contrast ratios and ensuring sufficient padding for better visual clarity.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Another shared challenge was implementing interactive elements such as buttons, sorting filters, and feedback forms. Ensuring that these components were keyboard-navigable and screen reader-friendly was crucial for accessibility. Issues with focus states and ARIA attributes were resolved by testing with accessibility tools and refining the markup for better compatibility with assistive technologies.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Through these challenges, key lessons were learned about the importance of performance optimization, responsive design, and inclusive accessibility practices. Prioritizing lightweight animations, flexible layouts, and semantic HTML has led to a more user-friendly and efficient experience across both pages.

            <section>
                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                <p>
                    In the development of both the <strong>Splash Screen</strong> and the <strong>Volunteer Programs Page</strong>, compliance with Janet regulations governing web page publication was a priority. Janet, being a network for research and education, sets specific guidelines to ensure that web content is accessible, secure, and respects user privacy. One of the primary considerations was adhering to accessibility standards such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). For both pages, semantic HTML was used, ensuring proper use of <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tags for better structure and accessibility.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    The pages also implement features like keyboard navigation for interactive elements, including buttons and dropdowns, which aligns with the Janet accessibility requirements. Additionally, the feedback form on the Volunteer Programs Page includes necessary validation and clear error messages, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can interact with the forms effectively.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    In terms of security and data protection, the pages do not collect or store sensitive personal information directly, maintaining compliance with Janet's data handling guidelines. However, it was ensured that any data transmission (such as when users submit feedback) occurs securely via HTTPS to protect user privacy. Furthermore, the pages are designed to be responsive, ensuring users across different devices and screen sizes can access the content without issues, which is a vital consideration for compliance with Janet’s regulations on usability and access.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Overall, the implementation adhered to best practices for web accessibility and security, reflecting an understanding of Janet regulations governing web page publication. The pages were designed to be inclusive, functional, and secure, with proper focus on user privacy and a commitment to providing a safe and accessible web environment.
