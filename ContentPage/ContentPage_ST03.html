                        <h3>Key Components of Physical Fitness</h3>
                        <p>A well-rounded fitness program targets several different components of health. These elements work together to enhance overall well-being, ensuring that every aspect of your fitness is being addressed.</p>
            
                        <div class="component">
                            <h4>Cardiovascular Endurance</h4>
                            <p>Cardiovascular endurance refers to the efficiency with which your heart, lungs, and blood vessels work together to deliver oxygen to your muscles and organs during prolonged periods of activity. It is a critical component of overall fitness because it boosts stamina, reduces the risk of heart disease, and increases your energy levels.</p>
                            <p>Activities like running, swimming, cycling, and dancing improve cardiovascular endurance and contribute to a healthy heart. With improved cardiovascular fitness, the body becomes more efficient at delivering oxygen, helping you perform daily tasks with less fatigue.</p>
                        </div>
            
                        <div class="component">
                            <h4>Muscular Strength & Endurance</h4>
                            <p>Muscular strength is the ability of a muscle or group of muscles to exert force in a single effort. This is important for performing everyday tasks that require lifting, pushing, or carrying. Muscular endurance, on the other hand, refers to the ability of muscles to perform repeated contractions over time without getting fatigued.</p>
                            <p>Strength and endurance are essential not just for athletic performance but for injury prevention and maintaining functional movement in daily life. Strength training exercises such as weightlifting, bodyweight exercises (like push-ups and squats), and resistance band workouts help develop and maintain muscular strength and endurance.</p>
                        </div>
            
                        <div class="component">
                            <h4>Flexibility & Mobility</h4>
                            <p>Flexibility is the range of motion in your muscles and joints. It is important because it helps maintain proper posture, prevents injuries, and improves your overall mobility. Stretching exercises, yoga, and Pilates can enhance flexibility, keeping muscles long and pliable.</p>
                            <p>Mobility, however, goes beyond flexibility. It refers to the ability to move freely without stiffness or discomfort. Mobility exercises often involve joint movements and help increase the fluidity of motion, improving functional movement and stability in day-to-day activities. Stretching regularly and incorporating mobility routines into your fitness plan will allow your body to perform a wider variety of movements with ease.</p>
                        </div>
            
                        <div class="component">
                            <h4>Body Composition</h4>
                            <p>Body composition refers to the proportion of fat and lean mass (muscles, bones, organs) in the body. Maintaining a healthy body composition is essential for overall health because an excess of body fat, particularly visceral fat, can increase the risk of developing chronic conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.</p>
                            <p>Healthy body composition is achieved by a combination of regular physical activity and a well-balanced diet. Cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and a nutrient-rich diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins help maintain a healthy body composition and promote fat loss while preserving lean muscle mass.</p>
                        </div>
            
                        <div class="component">
                            <h4>Mental & Emotional Well-being</h4>
                            <p>Physical fitness doesn't just impact the body; it also plays a vital role in your mental and emotional health. Regular exercise is proven to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, while also improving mood and mental clarity. Physical activity increases the release of endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers and mood enhancers.</p>
                            <p>Consistent exercise can improve sleep patterns, increase self-esteem, and boost cognitive function, leading to a more positive outlook on life. In addition to improving physical health, staying active allows for better mental focus, making it easier to tackle daily challenges and maintain a balanced life.</p>
